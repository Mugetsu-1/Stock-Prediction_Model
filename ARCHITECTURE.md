Notebook: Stock_Market_Prediction.ipynb
  - Data collection
  - Cleaning
  - EDA
  - Feature engineering
  - Model training/evaluation
  - Artifact export
        │
        ▼
Saved Artifacts (.pkl/.csv)
        │
        ▼
Streamlit App (app.py)
  - Loads saved artifacts
  - Live data fetch for selected ticker
  - Classical ML prediction OR ARIMA forecast
  - Displays prediction and charts
```

## 2. Training Pipeline (Notebook)

1. Download multi-ticker OHLCV data.
2. Normalize columns and clean missing values.
3. Export `cleaned_stock_data.csv`.
4. Perform EDA (price trends, return distribution, correlations).
5. Build engineered technical indicators.
6. Create targets for 1d and 5d horizons.
7. Train multiple models and rank by holdout metrics.
   - Includes optional XGBoost GPU candidate (CUDA when available).
8. Tune decision thresholds for classification.
9. Save best model artifacts for both horizons.

## 3. Inference Pipeline (Streamlit)

1. User selects horizon and algorithm.
2. App loads the corresponding model/scaler/features.
3. App downloads latest market data for selected ticker.
4. App computes the same engineered features as notebook.
5. App predicts direction and probabilities.
6. App renders prediction and technical charts.

## 4. Artifacts Contract

Daily (1d):
- `stock_prediction_model.pkl`
- `scaler.pkl`
- `model_info.pkl`

Weekly (5d):
- `stock_prediction_model_weekly.pkl`
- `scaler_weekly.pkl`
- `model_info_weekly.pkl`

Shared:
- `cleaned_stock_data.csv`

## 5. Design Principles

- Notebook is the single source of truth for training.
- App is kept simple and focused on inference/visualization.
- Feature generation must remain consistent between notebook and app.
- Time-aware splitting is used to reduce look-ahead leakage.
- GPU acceleration is optional and limited to notebook training candidates.
