# Stock Market Price Movement Prediction

A clean, notebook-first data science project that predicts stock direction for:
- **Next Day (1d)**
- **Next Week (5 trading days / 5d)**

The notebook is the main workflow for loading data, EDA, feature engineering, model training, evaluation, and artifact export.  
`app.py` is only for Streamlit inference and visualization.

### Optional GPU Acceleration

- Notebook training includes an optional **XGBoost GPU candidate**.
- Set `ENABLE_GPU = True` in the notebook to prefer CUDA (if available).
- If GPU/CUDA is not available, the notebook continues with CPU-based models.

```

## Formal Workflow (Objective-Aligned)

The notebook follows the assignment structure:
1. Data Collection and Initial Exploration
2. Data Cleaning and Transformation
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
4. Feature Engineering and Feature Selection
5. Model Development (multiple candidates)
6. Model Evaluation and Tuning
7. Final Model Saving (artifacts for Streamlit)

## How to Run

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Run the notebook and execute cells top-to-bottom:

```bash
jupyter notebook
```

3. Start Streamlit:

```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

## Notes

- The notebook saves model artifacts that are directly used by `app.py`.
- The Streamlit app supports:
  - **Classical ML inference** (using saved artifacts)
  - **ARIMA time-series inference** (live fit on recent close prices)
- Prediction UI shows:
  - **UP in green**
  - **DOWN in red**
