# Stock Market Prediction - Project Documentation

## Project Goal

Predict whether stock price direction will be **UP** or **DOWN** for:
- Next trading day (1d)
- Next trading week (5d)

This project follows the formal objective workflow and keeps implementation clean:
- Notebook for all data science work
- Streamlit app for inference UI only

## Notebook Responsibilities

`Stock_Market_Prediction.ipynb` handles:
1. Data loading from Yahoo Finance
2. Data cleaning and transformation
3. EDA and key visual analysis
4. Feature engineering and selection
5. Model development and comparison
6. Evaluation and threshold tuning
7. Saving artifacts for deployment

### Optional GPU Mode

- The notebook includes an optional XGBoost candidate with GPU preference.
- Enable it via `ENABLE_GPU = True` in the setup section.
- If CUDA is unavailable, training continues with CPU-capable candidates.

## Streamlit Responsibilities

`app.py` handles:
- Loading saved artifacts
- Live ticker selection and prediction
- Classical ML and ARIMA prediction modes
- Displaying:
  - UP (green)
  - DOWN (red)
  - probabilities and charts

## Main Dependencies

- pandas, numpy
- scikit-learn
- xgboost (optional GPU acceleration candidate)
- matplotlib, seaborn
- yfinance
- streamlit, plotly
- statsmodels
- joblib

## Output Files

- `cleaned_stock_data.csv`
- `stock_prediction_model.pkl`, `scaler.pkl`, `model_info.pkl`
- `stock_prediction_model_weekly.pkl`, `scaler_weekly.pkl`, `model_info_weekly.pkl`

## Quality and Readability

- The notebook is structured in clear numbered steps.
- Each stage has short, focused code blocks.
- Pipeline is reproducible by running cells top-to-bottom.
